# LearningLinq

## Overview
Series of Examples of Linq based on a youtube tutorial; see credits.
Each lesson is in its own project; each can be run independently.

## Notes
In the FakeDB - I have disabled Save/Load functionality. This means you always have a fresh databases, and your changes will not get saved. Easy enough to re-enable if you like; set the path of the database, remove the exceptions, init and save.

Template can be used to create a template, which can then be used to add new Linq_Examples. This sets up the dependencies and such.
